/**
 * Guards the fix for "switching libraries hangs".
 *
 * A switch through the recent list sends `library.open` for the replacement with
 * no preceding `library.close`, so the outgoing library's media work must be
 * stopped by the open path itself. Measured before the fix: switching away from
 * a busy network library never completed (≥90 s, loading overlay stuck, no
 * Worker activity logged); after it: 14330 ms.
 *
 * These are the rules a future refactor is most likely to break.
