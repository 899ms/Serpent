/**
 * Bounded async admission for Main-process filesystem work.
 *
 * Chromium can issue many overlapping `serpent://` range requests for one
 * visible card. Each `fs.promises.open`/`stat` occupies a libuv threadpool
 * slot (default 4). On a network volume those slots fill with SMB round
 * trips and the Electron main thread stops dispatching window input — the
 * browse surface looks frozen even though the renderer is still painting.
 *
 * Waiters stay in JavaScript, not in the threadpool, so pointer routing
 * continues while earlier opens complete.
